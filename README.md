# 42-Project-Submission-Checklist

A checklist that you can use before you submit your 42 C Project (Libft, Printf, Get_Next_Line, etc). This list will be updated over-time. 

- [ ] Correct Files
- Make sure all of the right files are there and are named correctly, check the subject pdf if needed. 

- [ ] Norminette
- Run Norminette for formatting, to run norminette type in norminette in terminal.

- [ ] Make
- If the project has a Makefile, type in make in the terminal. If the project doesn't have a Makefile, then write in an int main and type in ```gcc``` or ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra```

- [ ] Output
- Make sure that your program/function does the right output. To do the output of your program/function do ```./a.out``` and check if your output is correct. 

- [ ] Tester (Does Not Apply for Piscine)
- Run your project through testers to test your project functions as supposed to be. Testers can be found on the Discord page of that particular project. Use the minimum of 1 tester, however do recommend using 2 testers just in case. 

- [ ] Git Clone
- Git clone your project before clicking on â€˜set the project as finishedâ€™, to ensure an empty repo isnâ€™t submitted. To git clone your project, type in git clone <your git repo link> in your terminal. 

Moulinette is waiting, so good luck!
